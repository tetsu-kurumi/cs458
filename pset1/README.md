You should submit one file: player.py In addition, you should hand in a README file which explains what function does what, as well as a transcript including the output of Monte Carlo simulation, and the summary output of 100,000 game playing trials - how many games the player won. In the past when giving assignments involving automated game playing, I have awarded a prize to the most successful program. Keep that in mind.
