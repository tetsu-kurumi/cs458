      "and considers principle protection to make a decision on income portfolio stocks.\n",
      "We use S&P500 as the baseline, and analyze whether the stock will outperform S&P500 or not, and buy or hold if it will, and sell if it will not.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Explanation of Analyses]\n",
      "Analysis 1: Dividend yield prediction based on stock price prediction and dividend growth prediction through linear regression on historical data\n",
      "Dividend yeild prediction using linear regression on historical data involves using past dividend growth data to create a linear model that predicts dividends, \n",
      "and combines this with a stock price prediction model which uses past price data to create a linear model that predicts future stock prices. \n",
      "Then, we divide the predicted dividends by the predicted stock prices in order to obtain the predicted dividend yields for the next 5 years.\n",
      "In this program, we compare these predicted dividend yields of a given stock with the predicted dividend yields of the S&P500 ETF (SPY), \n",
      "and determine a stock to be outperforming S&P500 if the stock's predicted dividend yield is equal to or greater than that of the S&P500 ETF's \n",
      "majority of the years (>2years out of 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis 2: Beta\n",
      "Beta, a measure of a stock's volatility compared to the market, serves as a valuable tool when determining the suitability of a stock for an income portfolio. \n",
      "Stocks with beta values less than 1 typically exhibit lower volatility than the market, and these low beta stocks often belong to established companies \n",
      "in mature industries, known for their consistent earnings and dividend payments. By including such stocks in an income portfolio, \n",
      "investors can mitigate risk and ensure a smoother income stream. \n",
      "In this program, we determine a stock to be outperforming S&P500 in terms of it's stability if the stock has a beta equal to or smaller than one, \n",
      "and underperforming if greater than one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis 3: Principle protection\n",
      "Although an income portfolio focuses on the dividend yields more than the growth, in order to prevent net losses by holding the stock, \n",
      "we also consider net gain of holding the stock. In other words, we add up the predicted dividend payouts per stock for the next 5 years \n",
      "and sum it with the predicted delta of stock price (predicted stock price in 5 years - current price).\n",
      "If this sum is less than 0, we recommend to sell, since we predict that the stock will produce a net loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Results of Analyses]\n",
      "Analysis 1:\n",
      "AMCR has predicted dividend yields of ['0.0495', '0.0510', '0.0525', '0.0541', '0.0555'] over the next 5 years,\n",
      "and the predicted dividend yields for S&P500 is ['0.0133', '0.0131', '0.0129', '0.0127', '0.0126'].\n",
      "Therefore, AMCR is predicted to have a higher dividend yield than S&P500 in 5 of the next 5 years, which means that\n",
      "AMCR outperforms S&P500 in predicted dividend yields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis 2:\n",
      "AMCR's beta is 0.84, which is equal to or smaller than one.\n",
      "Therefore, AMCR outperforms S&P500 in beta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis 3:\n",
      "The predicted sum of dividend payments of AMCR in the next 5 years is 2.95,\n",
      "and the predicted delta of the stock price between the current price and the predicted price in 5 years is 2.02.\n",
      "Thus, the sum of the two is 4.97, which is equal to or greater than 0, \n",
      "and therefore, AMCR will produce a net gain in the next 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Decision Process]\n",
      "The primary metric that we consider is the predicted dividend yield. However, since beta is a good metric that reflects how stable the stock is, \n",
      "or in other words, how reliable the dividend payout is, we only recommend to buy if the stock outperforms the S&P500 in both predicted dividend yields \n",
      "and beta since it is liklely that the stock will achieve a large dividend yield. \n",
      "Thus, in other cases when only one of the metrics (between predicted dividend yields and beta) outperforms S&P500, \n",
      "we recommend to hold since there is a potential (but not certain) for the stock to achieve a decent dividend yield, \n",
      "and if neither of them are outperforming, we recommend to sell.\n",
      "Additionally, in all cases, we recommend to sell if the stock is predicted to produce a net loss or we cannot perform analysis on principle protection \n",
      "due to insufficient data in the next 5 years through principle protection analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Conclusion]\n",
      "Overall, the stock achieves principle protection (produces a net gain), and outperforms in predicted 5 year dividend yield and beta, thus according to the decision process described above, the Income Analysis yields a recommendation to buy AMCR.\n"
