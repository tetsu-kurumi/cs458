Assumptions
- it's a stock within a portfolio of other stocks -> strategize relative to other stocks
- client will ask about all of the stocks that they own in the portfolio -> nope nvm


STEPS
- determine which index we have to refer to and how to refer to them, by looking at the performance of the index for the objective
- compare the performance to the S&P 500

DCF

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is a method used to value a company based on its expected future cash flows. While DCF analysis is a widely used and respected valuation method, it does have its limitations and potential biases. Here are some factors to consider regarding whether DCF tends to undervalue stocks:

Subjectivity in Assumptions: DCF analysis requires making assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values. These assumptions can vary widely depending on the analyst's perspective and the data available. Small changes in these assumptions can significantly impact the calculated value.

Sensitivity to Growth Rates: DCF analysis heavily relies on estimating future growth rates. If the growth rates used in the analysis are too conservative, the calculated intrinsic value may be lower than the actual market value, leading to undervaluation. On the other hand, if growth rates are overestimated, it could lead to overvaluation.

Discount Rate Estimation: The discount rate used in DCF analysis (often the Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACC) reflects the risk associated with the investment. If the discount rate is too high, it will undervalue the stock, as it discounts future cash flows more aggressively. Conversely, if the discount rate is too low, it will overvalue the stock.

Inaccurate Cash Flow Projections: DCF analysis requires forecasting future cash flows accurately. If the projections are unrealistic or based on flawed assumptions, the calculated value will be inaccurate, potentially leading to undervaluation.

Market Inefficiencies: Markets may not always efficiently incorporate all available information into stock prices. In such cases, DCF analysis may provide a more accurate estimate of intrinsic value, which could suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to the current market price.

Long-Term Horizon: DCF analysis typically focuses on the long-term performance of a company. Short-term market fluctuations and sentiment may not be fully captured in the DCF valuation, leading to discrepancies between the calculated intrinsic value and the market price.

In summary, while DCF analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the intrinsic value of a stock, it is not immune to biases and limitations. Analysts should carefully consider the assumptions and inputs used in the analysis and be aware of potential undervaluation or overvaluation biases. Additionally, combining DCF analysis with other valuation methods and market analysis can provide a more comprehensive view of a stock's value.


PE
Using the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio as a sole metric for estimating intrinsic value can lead to potential overvaluation or undervaluation of stocks, depending on various factors. Here's why:

Limited Perspective: The P/E ratio represents the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings per share (EPS). While it provides a quick snapshot of a company's valuation relative to its earnings, it doesn't account for other critical factors such as growth prospects, industry dynamics, risk factors, or the quality of earnings.

Dependence on Earnings: The P/E ratio is highly dependent on a company's earnings. Companies with high P/E ratios might be considered overvalued if their earnings are not growing at a sufficient rate to justify their high valuation. Similarly, companies with low P/E ratios might be undervalued if their earnings growth potential is strong.

Cyclicality and Market Sentiment: P/E ratios can vary significantly across different market cycles and industries. During periods of high optimism, investors may be willing to pay a premium for earnings, leading to inflated P/E ratios. Conversely, during downturns or periods of pessimism, P/E ratios may be lower, potentially undervaluing stocks.

Comparative Analysis: Comparing P/E ratios across companies within the same industry or sector can provide insights into relative valuation. However, it's essential to consider differences in growth rates, risk profiles, and other qualitative factors that may affect valuation.

Earnings Manipulation: Companies can sometimes manipulate earnings figures to artificially inflate or deflate their P/E ratios. This can distort the true valuation of a company and lead to misinterpretations by investors.

Forward-looking Bias: The P/E ratio is backward-looking and based on historical earnings. It doesn't explicitly account for future growth prospects or changes in earnings quality, which are essential considerations for estimating intrinsic value.

In conclusion, while the P/E ratio can be a useful tool for assessing relative valuation and market sentiment, it should be used in conjunction with other valuation methods and comprehensive analysis. Relying solely on the P/E ratio for intrinsic value calculation may overlook important qualitative factors and lead to overvaluation or undervaluation of stocks.
